# Worldbuilder

This application will be able to help writers when *building fantasy worlds*.
They will be able to *keep track of* all the different places and people in an entire world.
This project is of interest to *me* because I am currently building a world to play
TTRPG games (like Dungeons and Dragons). I have a big interest in telling stories and 
a big part of that for me is creating an immersive world, which involves keeping track
of lots of locations. Currently, I am using a notetaking software called Obsidian which
is inspiring me to make something similar on my own!

## **Disclaimer for User Stories:**

A lot of my user stories are very similar or almost identical. The reason I have separated
them is I want to illustrate the tiers of specificity. I don't want to seem like I am trying
to copy and paste user stories to make this seem more impressive or to cheat the guidelines.
I believe that without these "redundant" user stories, I still have enough to make a 
good project out of.

## Phase 1 User Stories

- As a user, I want to add a continent to a world  
- As a user, I want to add land formations to a continent  
- As a user, I want to add settlements to land formations  
- As a user, I want to add locations (buildings, streets) to settlements  
- As a user, I want to add big items to locations (stoves, closets, chests)  
- As a user, I want to add small items to big items (as well as add small items to locations to be done later)
- All land formations, settlements, locations, big items, and small items
- should have editable names and descriptions and be deletable  
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of things inside a bigger thing (but only by one level)  
- As a user, I want to be able to search for Land Formations within a Continent

## Phase 2 User Stories:
- As a user, I want to have the option to save my progress before quitting the application
- As a user, I want to have the option to reload a project that was previously saved

USER STORIES TO BE DONE AT A LATER PHASE:
- As a user, I also want to add Locations to a Land Formation  
- As a user, I want to be able to add people to the world (move between the tiers to be done later)
